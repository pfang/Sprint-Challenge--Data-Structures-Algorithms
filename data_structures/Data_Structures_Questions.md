Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` method?
O(n) all nodes are visited

2. What is the space complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` function?
O(h), h is the height of the tree

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method?
O(n) since every node is visited

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method? 
O(w), w is width of the tree

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
O(n * logn)

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
O(2n)
